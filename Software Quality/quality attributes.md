# Where Performance Fits Among the “-ilities”

Software engineering often discusses *quality attributes* (the “-ilities”):

- **Performance** → speed, efficiency, scalability *(benchmarking & profiling live here)*
- **Reliability** → correctness, fault tolerance, availability
- **Maintainability** → how easy it is to modify and extend
- **Usability** → how intuitive it is for end users
- **Portability** → how easily it runs on different platforms
- **Security** → protection from unauthorized access or misuse
- **Scalability** → how well it handles growth in load/data
- **Testability** → how easily it can be tested and verified
